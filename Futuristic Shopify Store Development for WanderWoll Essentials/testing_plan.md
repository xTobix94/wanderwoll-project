# 3D Model Testing and Validation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the testing and validation approach for the WanderWoll essentials 3D mockup system to ensure optimal performance, visual quality, and user experience across devices.

## Testing Environments

### Desktop Browsers
- Chrome (latest version)
- Firefox (latest version)
- Safari (latest version)
- Edge (latest version)

### Mobile Devices
- iOS Safari (iPhone 12 and newer)
- Android Chrome (mid-range and high-end devices)
- Android Samsung Internet

## Performance Metrics

### Loading Time
- Initial load: < 3 seconds
- Model loading: < 2 seconds
- Texture swapping: < 500ms

### Frame Rate
- Desktop: Minimum 60 FPS
- Mobile: Minimum 30 FPS

### Memory Usage
- Desktop: < 200MB
- Mobile: < 100MB

## Visual Quality Testing

### Model Accuracy
- Proportions match real products
- Fabric draping looks realistic
- Details are clearly visible

### Texture Quality
- Fabric texture is recognizable
- Color accuracy matches physical products
- Normal maps create realistic surface detail

### Lighting and Shadows
- Materials respond correctly to lighting
- Shadows enhance 3D perception
- Reflections on appropriate surfaces

## Functional Testing

### Rotation Controls
- 360Â° rotation works smoothly
- Touch/drag sensitivity is appropriate
- Auto-rotation functions correctly

### Zoom Controls
- Zoom in/out functions properly
- Maximum/minimum zoom limits work
- Pinch-to-zoom on mobile works correctly

### Color Variants
- All color options display correctly
- Color switching is instantaneous
- Textures update appropriately with color changes

## Responsive Design Testing

### Viewport Adaptations
- Viewer resizes appropriately on window resize
- Controls are accessible on all screen sizes
- Canvas maintains proper aspect ratio

### Touch Interactions
- Touch controls work on mobile and tablets
- Gestures (pinch, rotate) function correctly
- Controls are large enough for touch targets

## Accessibility Testing

### Keyboard Navigation
- Tab navigation works for controls
- Keyboard shortcuts function correctly
- Focus states are visible

### Screen Reader Compatibility
- Alt text for controls is provided
- ARIA attributes are implemented
- Meaningful feedback is provided

## Performance Optimization Tests

### Asset Loading
- Progressive loading functions correctly
- Preloading of critical assets works
- Caching strategy is effective

### Rendering Optimization
- LOD (Level of Detail) switching works correctly
- Frame rate remains stable during interaction
- Memory usage remains within limits

## Browser Compatibility Testing

### WebGL Support
- Fallback for non-WebGL browsers works
- Different WebGL versions are supported
- Browser-specific optimizations function correctly

### Mobile Browser Quirks
- iOS Safari specific issues are addressed
- Android Chrome specific issues are addressed
- Touch event differences are handled

## User Experience Testing

### Intuitiveness
- Users can interact without instructions
- Control feedback is clear
- Learning curve is minimal

### Visual Feedback
- Loading indicators display correctly
- Error states are handled gracefully
- Success states are clear

## Test Cases

1. **Initial Loading**
   - Verify loading indicator displays correctly
   - Measure time to first meaningful display
   - Verify model appears correctly after loading

2. **Rotation Interaction**
   - Test mouse drag rotation on desktop
   - Test touch rotation on mobile
   - Verify auto-rotation starts/stops correctly

3. **Zoom Functionality**
   - Test zoom in/out buttons
   - Test scroll wheel zoom on desktop
   - Test pinch-to-zoom on mobile

4. **Color Variant Selection**
   - Test each color variant selection
   - Verify correct color/texture is applied
   - Measure time for color/texture swap

5. **Responsive Behavior**
   - Test various viewport sizes
   - Test orientation changes on mobile
   - Verify controls adapt to screen size

6. **Performance Under Load**
   - Test with multiple 3D viewers on same page
   - Monitor memory usage over time
   - Test performance after extended interaction

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] User experience feedback incorporated

## Reporting

Test results will be documented with:
- Screenshots of the 3D viewer on different devices
- Performance metrics data
- Browser compatibility matrix
- Identified issues and resolutions
- Recommendations for further optimization

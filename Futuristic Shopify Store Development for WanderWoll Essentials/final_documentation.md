## 3D Mockup System

### Overview

The 3D mockup system provides interactive 3D visualizations of WanderWoll products, allowing customers to view products from all angles, zoom in on details, and see different color variants in real-time.

### Implementation Approach

Rather than building custom 3D models from scratch, the system leverages existing free resources:

1. **VirtualThreads.io Integration**: Primary platform for 3D mockup generation
2. **CGTrader Assets**: High-quality 3D fashion models from CGTrader's free library
3. **Optimization Pipeline**: Conversion and optimization for web performance

### Key Components

- **3D Viewer**: Interactive viewer with rotation, zoom, and color switching
- **Model Loader**: Efficient loading system with progressive enhancement
- **Texture Manager**: Handles different material types and color variations
- **Performance Optimizer**: Ensures smooth performance across devices

### Integration with Shopify

The 3D viewer is integrated into product pages using a Liquid snippet:

```liquid
{% render 'virtualthreads-widget' with 
  product: product,
  enable_rotation: true,
  enable_zoom: true,
  fallback_image: product.featured_image
%}
```

### Fallback Mechanism

For browsers or devices that don't support WebGL, the system automatically falls back to high-quality static images, ensuring all users can view products regardless of their device capabilities.

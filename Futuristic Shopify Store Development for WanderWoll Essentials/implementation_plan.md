# 3D Mockup System Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation strategy for the WanderWoll essentials 3D mockup system, which will enable interactive 3D visualization of merino products in the Shopify store.

## Technology Selection

After evaluating the requirements and constraints, we will use the following technologies:

1. **Three.js**: A lightweight JavaScript 3D library that provides high-performance WebGL rendering
   - Advantages: Widely supported, extensive documentation, good performance on mobile
   - Integration: Can be embedded directly in Shopify theme

2. **glTF Format**: Industry standard for 3D models
   - Advantages: Optimized file size, texture support, animation capabilities
   - Compatibility: Well-supported by Three.js and modern browsers

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Basic 3D Viewer (MVP)

1. **Core 3D Engine Setup**
   - Implement Three.js integration in theme
   - Create responsive canvas container
   - Set up camera, lighting, and scene controls

2. **Initial Product Models**
   - Develop base 3D models for priority products:
     - Unisex Merino T-shirt
     - Merino Hoodie
   - Implement realistic material textures
   - Optimize models for web performance (< 2MB each)

3. **Interactive Controls**
   - 360Â° rotation functionality
   - Zoom controls
   - Mobile touch support
   - Fallback for older browsers

4. **UI Integration**
   - "View in 3D" buttons on product pages
   - Loading indicators
   - Control instructions for users

### Phase 2: Advanced Features (Post-MVP)

1. **Color Variants**
   - Dynamic texture/color switching
   - Material property adjustments

2. **Enhanced Interaction**
   - Detail zoom functionality
   - Fabric texture close-ups
   - Animation sequences (e.g., rotating garment)

3. **AR Preparation**
   - Model optimization for AR
   - AR marker integration
   - Mobile device detection

## Technical Implementation Details

### 3D Model Creation Process

1. **Base Model Development**
   - Create wireframe models of garments
   - Add realistic fabric draping and folds
   - Implement proper topology for animation

2. **Texture Mapping**
   - Develop high-quality merino wool texture
   - Create normal maps for fabric detail
   - Implement PBR (Physically Based Rendering) materials

3. **Optimization**
   - Reduce polygon count for web performance
   - Implement LOD (Level of Detail) for different devices
   - Compress textures appropriately

### Integration with Shopify Theme

1. **Viewer Component**
   - Create reusable 3D viewer snippet
   - Implement lazy loading for performance
   - Add event listeners for user interaction

2. **Product Page Integration**
   - Replace standard product images with 3D viewer when available
   - Maintain fallback images for non-compatible browsers
   - Synchronize 3D model variants with product variants

3. **Mobile Optimization**
   - Adjust rendering quality based on device capabilities
   - Implement touch controls for mobile users
   - Optimize canvas size for different screen dimensions

## Performance Considerations

1. **Asset Loading**
   - Progressive loading of 3D assets
   - Preloading of critical models
   - Caching strategy for repeat visitors

2. **Rendering Optimization**
   - Limit draw calls and scene complexity
   - Use efficient lighting techniques
   - Implement frame rate throttling when necessary

3. **Memory Management**
   - Proper disposal of 3D objects when not in view
   - Texture atlas usage where appropriate
   - Browser memory monitoring

## Testing Strategy

1. **Device Testing**
   - Desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
   - Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
   - Tablet devices

2. **Performance Testing**
   - Loading time measurement
   - Frame rate monitoring
   - Memory usage tracking

3. **User Experience Testing**
   - Control responsiveness
   - Intuitive interaction
   - Visual quality assessment

## Next Steps

1. Set up Three.js development environment
2. Create initial 3D model for Merino T-shirt
3. Implement basic viewer functionality
4. Integrate with product template
5. Test and optimize for performance

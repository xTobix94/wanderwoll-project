# Placeholder for 3D Product Models

This file serves as a placeholder for the actual 3D product models that will be created and validated in the next development phase.

## Priority Models for Validation

1. **Unisex Merino T-shirt**
   - Status: To be created
   - Format: glTF (.glb)
   - Target completion: Before AR integration

2. **Merino Hoodie**
   - Status: To be created
   - Format: glTF (.glb)
   - Target completion: Before AR integration

## Validation Process

Each model will undergo the following validation steps:
1. Visual quality assessment
2. Performance testing (file size, loading time)
3. Texture mapping verification
4. Color variant testing
5. Mobile compatibility testing
6. Integration testing with the 3D viewer

## Next Steps

The actual 3D model creation and validation will be the focus of the next development phase, ensuring all requirements are met before proceeding to AR functionality integration.

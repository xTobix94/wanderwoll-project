# Merino Hoodie 3D Model Development Progress

## Current Status: In Development

This document tracks the development progress of the 3D model for the WanderWoll essentials Merino Hoodie.

## Development Stages

### 1. Reference Gathering âœ“
- Collected reference images of merino hoodies
- Documented key measurements and proportions
- Identified distinctive features (hood style, pocket design, zipper/drawstrings)

### 2. Base Mesh Creation (Pending)
- Create low-poly base mesh with proper topology
- Set up UV coordinates for texture mapping
- Establish proper scale and proportions

### 3. Detail Modeling (Pending)
- Add hood details and structure
- Model pocket and zipper elements
- Create natural fabric folds and draping
- Add drawstrings if applicable

### 4. UV Mapping & Texturing (Pending)
- Create efficient UV layout
- Develop base color textures for each variant:
  - Forest Green (#2E8B57)
  - Beige (#F5DEB3)
  - Black (#000000)
- Create normal maps for fabric detail
- Develop roughness maps for realistic material properties

### 5. Optimization (Pending)
- Reduce polygon count while maintaining visual quality
- Optimize texture sizes
- Create LOD (Level of Detail) versions for mobile

### 6. Export & Integration (Pending)
- Export to glTF (.glb) format
- Test in Three.js environment
- Integrate with WanderWoll 3D viewer

## Technical Specifications

- **Target Polygon Count**: 12,000-15,000 polygons
- **Texture Resolution**: 1024x1024px (diffuse, normal), 512x512px (roughness)
- **Target File Size**: < 2MB

## Next Steps

1. Begin base mesh modeling after T-shirt model completion
2. Focus on hood structure and proportions
3. Plan UV layout for efficient texturing

## Estimated Completion

Expected completion date: [To be determined based on T-shirt model validation results]

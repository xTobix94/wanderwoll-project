# Merino T-Shirt 3D Model Development Progress

## Current Status: In Development

This document tracks the development progress of the 3D model for the WanderWoll essentials Unisex Merino T-shirt.

## Development Stages

### 1. Reference Gathering ✓
- Collected reference images of merino t-shirts
- Documented key measurements and proportions
- Identified distinctive features (collar style, sleeve length, hem details)

### 2. Base Mesh Creation ⚙️
- Creating low-poly base mesh with proper topology
- Setting up UV coordinates for texture mapping
- Establishing proper scale and proportions

### 3. Detail Modeling (Pending)
- Add collar details
- Model sleeve cuffs and hem
- Create natural fabric folds and draping

### 4. UV Mapping & Texturing (Pending)
- Create efficient UV layout
- Develop base color textures for each variant:
  - Forest Green (#2E8B57)
  - Beige (#F5DEB3)
  - Black (#000000)
- Create normal maps for fabric detail
- Develop roughness maps for realistic material properties

### 5. Optimization (Pending)
- Reduce polygon count while maintaining visual quality
- Optimize texture sizes
- Create LOD (Level of Detail) versions for mobile

### 6. Export & Integration (Pending)
- Export to glTF (.glb) format
- Test in Three.js environment
- Integrate with WanderWoll 3D viewer

## Technical Specifications

- **Target Polygon Count**: 8,000-10,000 polygons
- **Texture Resolution**: 1024x1024px (diffuse, normal), 512x512px (roughness)
- **Target File Size**: < 1.5MB

## Next Steps

1. Complete base mesh modeling
2. Begin detail work on collar and sleeves
3. Set up initial UV mapping
4. Create test textures for material validation

## Estimated Completion

Expected completion date: [To be determined based on validation results]

# AR Integration Test Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the testing strategy for validating the AR try-on functionality for the WanderWoll essentials Shopify store. The testing will ensure that the AR features work correctly across different devices and browsers, with appropriate fallback mechanisms.

## Test Environments

### Devices
- **Desktop**
  - Windows 10/11 (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
  - macOS (Safari, Chrome, Firefox)
- **Mobile**
  - iOS (Safari, Chrome)
  - Android (Chrome, Samsung Internet)

### Network Conditions
- Fast WiFi (50+ Mbps)
- Slow WiFi (5-10 Mbps)
- Mobile Data (4G/LTE)
- Mobile Data (3G) - fallback testing

## Test Cases

### 1. AR Module Initialization

| Test ID | Description | Expected Result | Priority |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|----------|

| AR-INIT-03 | Initialize AR module with no API key | Default demo key is used | Medium |
| AR-INIT-04 | Initialize AR module with custom configuration | Configuration is applied correctly | Medium |

### 2. AR Viewer Component

| Test ID | Description | Expected Result | Priority |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|----------|

| AR-VIEW-05 | Test viewer on mobile device | Viewer is responsive and usable | High |
| AR-VIEW-06 | Test viewer with WebGL disabled | Fallback experience is shown | High |

### 3. AR Session

| Test ID | Description | Expected Result | Priority |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| AR-SESS-01 | Start AR session | Camera permission requested, session starts | High |
| AR-SESS-02 | Deny camera permission | Appropriate error shown, fallback activated | High |
| AR-SESS-03 | End AR session | Session ends cleanly, resources released | High |
| AR-SESS-04 | Test body tracking | Model aligns with user's body | High |
| AR-SESS-05 | Generate size recommendation | Accurate size recommendation shown | Medium |
| AR-SESS-06 | Capture AR screenshot | Screenshot captured successfully | Medium |
| AR-SESS-07 | Share AR experience | Sharing options shown or Web Share API used | Low |

### 4. Shopify Integration

| Test ID | Description | Expected Result | Priority |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| AR-SHOP-01 | Include AR viewer snippet in product page | Snippet renders correctly | High |
| AR-SHOP-02 | Extract product information | Correct product type and color detected | High |
| AR-SHOP-03 | Change product variant | AR viewer updates with new variant | High |
| AR-SHOP-04 | Test with metafields enabled/disabled | AR viewer shows/hides appropriately | Medium |
| AR-SHOP-05 | Test with multiple product types | Correct 3D models load for each type | Medium |

### 5. Performance Testing

| Test ID | Description | Expected Result | Priority |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| AR-PERF-01 | Measure initial load time | Under 3 seconds on fast connection | High |
| AR-PERF-02 | Measure AR session start time | Under 2 seconds on fast connection | High |
| AR-PERF-03 | Monitor memory usage | Under 300MB during AR session | Medium |
| AR-PERF-04 | Test frame rate during AR session | Minimum 30 FPS on mid-range devices | High |
| AR-PERF-05 | Test with slow network connection | Appropriate loading indicators, graceful degradation | Medium |

### 6. Error Handling

| Test ID | Description | Expected Result | Priority |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| AR-ERR-01 | Test with unavailable VirtualThreads API | Fallback to local 3D viewer | High |
| AR-ERR-02 | Test with missing 3D model | Error message shown, fallback model used | High |
| AR-ERR-03 | Test with WebXR not supported | Fallback to non-AR 3D viewer | High |
| AR-ERR-04 | Test with JavaScript errors | Errors caught and logged, no page crashes | High |
| AR-ERR-05 | Test recovery from temporary errors | System recovers when conditions improve | Medium |

## Testing Procedure

1. **Unit Testing**
   - Test individual components in isolation
   - Verify error handling and edge cases
   - Ensure all public methods work as expected

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Test AR module with viewer component
   - Test viewer component with Shopify integration
   - Verify data flow between components

3. **End-to-End Testing**
   - Test complete AR experience on product page
   - Verify all user interactions work correctly
   - Test across different devices and browsers

4. **Performance Testing**
   - Measure load times and resource usage
   - Identify and address performance bottlenecks
   - Ensure smooth experience on target devices

## Test Reporting

For each test case, record:
- Pass/Fail status
- Actual result vs. expected result
- Environment details (device, browser, etc.)
- Screenshots or recordings of issues
- Any workarounds or fixes applied

## Acceptance Criteria

The AR integration will be considered successful when:
1. All high-priority tests pass on target devices and browsers
2. Performance meets or exceeds target metrics
3. Fallback mechanisms work correctly when AR is not supported
4. User experience is intuitive and error-free

## Next Steps

After successful testing:
1. Document any known limitations or edge cases
2. Prepare final integration into production theme
3. Create user documentation and help resources
4. Plan for future enhancements based on test findings

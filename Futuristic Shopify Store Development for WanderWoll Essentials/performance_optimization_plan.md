# Performance Optimization Plan for WanderWoll essentials

## Goals

- Achieve Lighthouse scores of 90+ for Mobile and Desktop.
- Ensure initial page load time under 3 seconds.
- Optimize 3D/AR asset loading for smooth user experience.
- Minimize JavaScript and CSS impact on performance.
- Ensure efficient Liquid code execution.

## Areas of Optimization

### 1. Frontend Assets

- **Images**:
  - [ ] Compress all theme images (JPG, PNG, SVG) using appropriate tools (e.g., TinyPNG, SVGO).
  - [ ] Implement lazy loading for below-the-fold images.
  - [ ] Use responsive images (`srcset`, `<picture>`) to serve appropriately sized images.
  - [ ] Convert images to modern formats like WebP where possible.
- **CSS**:
  - [ ] Minify all CSS files.
  - [ ] Combine CSS files where possible to reduce requests.
  - [ ] Remove unused CSS rules.
  - [ ] Prioritize critical CSS for above-the-fold content.
- **JavaScript**:
  - [ ] Minify all JavaScript files.
  - [ ] Combine JavaScript files where possible.
  - [ ] Defer or async load non-critical JavaScript.
  - [ ] Analyze and optimize JavaScript execution time.
  - [ ] Remove unused JavaScript code or libraries.

### 2. Shopify Theme (Liquid)

- [ ] Analyze Liquid rendering performance using Shopify Theme Inspector.
- [ ] Optimize loops and conditional statements.
- [ ] Minimize the use of `capture` and complex assignments.
- [ ] Reduce the number of `include` statements where possible.
- [ ] Optimize section rendering performance.

### 3. 3D/AR Assets

- **Models (GLB/GLTF)**:
  - [ ] Optimize model geometry (reduce polygon count where possible without sacrificing quality).
  - [ ] Use Draco compression for geometry.
  - [ ] Ensure models are under the recommended size limit (e.g., < 2MB).
- **Textures**:
  - [ ] Use efficient texture formats (e.g., KTX2 with Basis Universal compression).
  - [ ] Optimize texture dimensions (power-of-two sizes).
  - [ ] Compress textures appropriately.
- **Loading Strategy**:
  - [ ] Implement progressive loading for 3D assets.
  - [ ] Use placeholders or loading indicators while assets load.
  - [ ] Optimize the loading sequence of 3D/AR components.

### 4. External Integrations & APIs

- **VirtualThreads.io, Mockey.ai, etc.**:
  - [ ] Implement robust caching for API responses.
  - [ ] Load external widgets/scripts asynchronously.
  - [ ] Optimize API call frequency.
  - [ ] Ensure efficient data transfer formats.

### 5. Server & Network

- [ ] Leverage Shopify's CDN effectively.
- [ ] Enable browser caching for static assets.
- [ ] Minimize redirects.

## Tools

- Google Lighthouse
- Shopify Theme Inspector
- WebPageTest
- Browser Developer Tools (Network, Performance tabs)
- Image compression tools (TinyPNG, Squoosh)
- CSS/JS minification tools
- 3D model optimization tools (glTF-Transform, Blender)

## Process

1. **Baseline Measurement**: Run Lighthouse and WebPageTest to establish current performance metrics.
2. **Identify Bottlenecks**: Analyze reports to pinpoint key areas for improvement.
3. **Implement Optimizations**: Apply optimization techniques systematically, starting with high-impact areas.
4. **Test & Verify**: Re-run performance tests after each significant optimization to measure impact.
5. **Iterate**: Continue optimizing until performance goals are met.
6. **Document**: Record all optimizations applied and their results.
